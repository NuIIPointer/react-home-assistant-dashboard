### Part 2

Here we setup a state management system using Zustand, to easily retrieve data from HA and start to update our application based on these changes.

What we cover:

1. Setting up the state manager
2. Setting up some hooks to be able to retrieve the current information for an entity
3. Setting up some hooks to call service like toggling a switch or setting color temperature for a light
4. Throttling the updates so we're not upating constantly with all updates from HA and just taking the latest updates.
